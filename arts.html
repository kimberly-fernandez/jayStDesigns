<p><img src="pottery.jpg" width="212" height="203" alt="Pottery" align ="left" hspace="5"/></p>
<p><font color="white">Pottery is the process of forming vessels and other objects with clay and 
other ceramic materials, which are fired at high temperatures to give them a hard, durable form. 
Major types include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by 
a potter is also called a pottery. The definition of pottery used by the American 
Society for Testing and Materials, is "all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, 
except technical, structural, and refractory products." In archaeology, especially of ancient and 
prehistoric periods, "pottery" often means vessels only, and figures of the same material are 
called "terracottas".</font></p>

<p><font color="white">Around 600 B.C., Greece developed one of the great civilizations in the history 
of the world. Sculpture became one of the most important forms of expression for the Greeks. The Greek 
belief that "man is the measure of all things" is nowhere more clearly shown than in Greek sculpture.

<p><img src="stainedGlass.jpg" width="200" height="260" alt="Stained Glass" align="left" hspace="5"/></p>
<p><font color="white">Colored glass has been made since ancient times. Both the Egyptians and 
the Romans manufactured small colored glass objects.Stained glass gained recognition as a Christian 
art form sometime in the fourth century as Christians began to build churches. The spread of Christianity 
throughout Europe is directly related to the expansion of stained glass across the globe and made stained 
glass the dominant art form of the new millennium. One of the oldest known examples of multiple pieces 
of colored glass used in a window were found at St. Paul's Monastery in Jarrow, England, founded in 
686 AD. The oldest complete European windows are thought to be five relatively sophisticated figures in
Ausburg Cathedral.</font></p>

<p><img src="painting.jpg" width="308" height="205" alt="Sculpting" align="right" hspace="5"/></p>
<p><font color="white">Painting, the expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain 
aesthetic qualities, in a two-dimensional visual language. The elements of this language—its shapes, 
lines, colours, tones, and textures—are used in various ways to produce sensations of volume, space, 
movement, and light on a flat surface. These elements are combined into expressive patterns in order 
to represent real or supernatural phenomena, to interpret a narrative theme, or to create wholly abstract
 visual relationships.</font></p>
